# LocalDrop — Homebrew formula for macOS.
#
# Published to the personal tap:
#     brew tap abhi-subedi/localdrop
#     brew install localdrop
#
# CI regenerates this file on every release (.github/workflows/release.yml),
# substituting the version and the per-architecture sha256, so it always points
# at a real, checksummed artefact.
#
# Homebrew's rules shape everything below: no `sudo`, no writing outside the
# prefix, no service auto-install. LocalDrop runs as a user-level daemon you
# start yourself, which is the right default for a LAN file server anyway.
#
# There are no runtime dependencies: the binary is self-contained, and the
# embedded PostgreSQL it starts needs nothing installed.

    # aborts the whole install - so install them when they are there rather than
    # making an older-release user fail over a packaging nicety.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      LocalDrop is a user-level daemon; Homebrew will not start it for you.

        localdrop              # start it (Ctrl-C to stop)
        localdrop install-service   # instead, run it at login via launchd

      It serves http://<your-lan-ip>:8080 and prints a first-run setup token.
      Files and the database live in ~/Library/Application Support/LocalDrop.

      Configuration: ~/Library/Application Support/LocalDrop/localdrop.env
      Full reference:  docs/CONFIGURATION.md in the repository.

      If you would rather use an existing PostgreSQL, set LOCALDROP_DATABASE_URL
      in that file; otherwise LocalDrop starts its own embedded cluster and you
      need no database at all.

  test do
    # --check proves the bundle is self-sufficient; it needs no database and
